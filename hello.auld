Happy New Year World!
Kevlin
Frae the new year!
And me to you!
And great tidings o'er all the world

We wish greetings all
Frae o
And no matter how small sing "Hello"
But we cannot sing for all of the day'o

We'll sing tidings to all to great and to small!
And include all of this world in our singing!
And simple it may be
And rhymes you can see
And yet this syntax really limits us so!

And so blocks of text appear
And we've forgot the new year
And we fiddle the register here!

And so blocks of text appear
And we've forgot the new year
And we fiddle the register here!

And although all is not lost
And though many lines be the cost
And the language gets embossed!

And these chains!
Frae o

And while this pentameter is off
And we can do nothing but scoff!

And although all is not lost
And though many lines be the cost
And the language gets embossed!

And as the end it comes near
And we thought yes, o-dear,
And we figured we could do this in tune!

And have the structure the same
And use the tune again
And copy that that inspired us here!

And my prose they are lacking
And I may be slacking
And "brute forcing" this a lot!
And o!
Frae o

Should auld acquaintance be forgot
Sin auld lang syne o
